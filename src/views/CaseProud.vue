      <h4>A 3-person team</h4>
      <p>I was not alone. Sergio, my partner in QuizViajero, CoffeeBreak and other ventures, was in charge of the Marketing stuff: defining the value proposition, content for the landing page, and acquiring leads. Santiago, expert in Blockchain was in charge of providing the web3 API for minting the NFTs.</p>

      <h4>My job</h4>
      <p>As the Product co-founder I was in charge of doing the whole work of a Product squad (Design, Full-stack Development, UX Research, Testing, etc) with no budget for involving other people. Here is how I managed to build an MVP in just 10 weeks.</p>

      <h4>Week 1: Collecting potential users</h4>
      <p>Before starting to Design I created a form using Airtable to collect potential users willing to collaborate with a 30 minute call to better understand how they solve the problem nowadays. We distributed the form using Twitter, Linkedin and Mailchimp and collected info from +200 team leaders willing to collaborate during the whole process and scheduled +20 calls to better understand the problem.</p>

      <h4>Week 2: UX Research - Understanding the problem</h4>
      <p>We started scheduling calls in the first week and after two weeks of calls we felt that we had a better understanding of the problem: where do current solutions fell short, what works in a sustainable way, what kinds of tools were used in large enterprises and how do people manage recognition in small startups.</p>

      <h4>Week 3: Wireframing - Explore possible solutions</h4>
      <p>With the conclusions of the research I jumped to Figma to start sketching different solutions and after a week of iterating the wireframes with the team we managed to reach a consensus for the prototype that we were going to be building. We also tested this hypothesis calling some of the leads to be sure we were on the right path.</p>

      <h4>Week 4: UI Design</h4>
      <p>Usually a decent nice design is enough for a prototype, but in this case the value proposition </p>
